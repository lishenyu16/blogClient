        <div>If you checked out the ‚ÄúAbout Me‚Äù page then you know my name is Shenyu.  Looking at the front page, you probably saw that 
this is a computer science blog(or maybe some other articles about my life? lol).</div><br>
        <div>Glad you came by.  I wanted to welcome you and let you know I appreciate you spending time here at the blog very much.  
Everyone is so busy and life moves pretty fast,  so I really do appreciate you taking time out of your busy day to check out
my blog. Thanks.</div><br>
        <div> Another thing I will always appreciate is your feedback to the blog.  If you have any comments or suggestions I welcome them
and would love to hear them.  Always.  Not that all criticism is a fun thing but I think honest criticism given in an honest
positive manner is something we can all learn and grow from if we are open to hearing it.  I will always listen to your ideas.
So I do welcome your suggestions for the blog...</div><br>
        <div>Always.</div><br>
        <div>I will always do my best to bring you content that will interest, inspire, motivate and maybe even have you walking away
thinking about and seeing things in a different way than before you came.  I want to blog about more than just computer science
and‚Ä¶  Life is so much more than that and I want to touch on everything because I think our lives are more than just sitting in front of screens.</div>
        <div>This blog will always be changing because I am.  You are.  The world is.  So don‚Äôt get too comfortable.  I like to surprise
from time to time, I just might throw you a curve ball every now and then.  üòâ</div><br>
        <div>Thanks for letting me,</div><br>
